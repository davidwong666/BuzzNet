# For Windows Machine:

Run `git config --global core.autocrlf false` and `git config --global core.eol lf` to prevent line ending issues.

I've implemented a simple but comprehensive set of functions for both frontend and backend. Here's what I've created:

- Backend:
  MongoDB Post Model: Created a schema for posts with fields for title, content, author, likes, and creation date.
  Database Connection: Set up a MongoDB connection configuration with error handling.
  Post Controller: Implemented controller functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and a like function.
  Routes: Created API routes for posts with appropriate HTTP methods.
  Express Server: Updated the main server file to use routes and DB connection.
  Deployed on Vercel https://vercel.com/nokktsangs-projects/buzz-net-backend

- Frontend:
  Post List Component: Fetches and displays posts from the API.
  Post Item Component: Displays individual posts with formatted date, expandable content, and like functionality.
  Post Form Component: Allows users to create new posts with validation.
  Main App Component: Integrates all components with a clean layout and refresh functionality.
  Real-time refreshing of the webpage
  CSS Styling: Added comprehensive styling for a modern, responsive UI.
