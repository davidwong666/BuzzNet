# Working with Your Docker Environment

- **Start Docker**: `docker-compose up -d` (-d: detached mode)
- **Stop Docker**: `docker-compose down`
- **Check Docker Status**: `docker ps`
- **Check Docker Logs**: `docker logs dev-environment` or `docker-compose logs dev`

# For Windows Machine:

Run `git config --global core.autocrlf false` and `git config --global core.eol lf` to prevent line ending issues.

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

npm start

npm run build
Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test
Starts the test runner.

npm run eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

cd /app/frontend
npm start
